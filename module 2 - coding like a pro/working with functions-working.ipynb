    "Functions are python objects that facilitates re-usability of a program/code. They allow you to write smarter, neater codes that will increase your code efficiency. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last question of our module-1 assignment, we needed to replace mutiple punctuation marks (and new line character) from a text. We did that by repeat a code line many times until all the symbols in the text were replaced (with nothing). That was cool but grossly inefficient. A better solution would be to define a function to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general format of a function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def function_name(inputs):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    docstrings\n",

    "    instructions to execute\n",
    "    return output\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "The docstrings are help information on what the function does; basically, to help you or other users remember what the function does, the inputs it takes and the outputs it generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all functions require inputs; some functions operate on some default values inbuilt into them by the programmer.\n",
    "\n",
